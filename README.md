# Cell Segmentation Analysis Tool

## Description

This project provides tools for analyzing and segmenting cell images using image processing techniques and machine learning. It includes Streamlit applications for generating optimal processing parameters from a control image and testing these parameters on other images. The core methods involve noise reduction, HSV color masking, morphological operations (dilation, closing), watershed segmentation, and K-Means clustering to analyze cell properties. An experimental notebook exploring the StarDist library for segmentation is also included.

## Features

* **Parameter Generation (`ParameterGen.py`):**
    * Interactive Streamlit interface to tune image processing parameters (noise thresholds, HSV masks, morphological operations, watershed).
    * Applies various OpenCV functions: `noiseCleanup`, `hsvMask`, `dilate`, `holeClose`, `distanceTransform`, `watershed`.
    * Performs K-Means clustering on cell intensity features (using Yellowbrick for optimal K selection).
    * Calculates metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) between color channels and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for clustering.
    * Outputs optimal parameters to `parameters.yaml` and detailed analysis to an Excel file (`Romidepsin.xlsx`).
* **Segmentation Testing (`Tester.py`):**
    * Streamlit interface to apply parameters generated by `ParameterGen.py` (read from `parameters.yaml`) to a test image.
    * Performs the same image processing and segmentation pipeline.
    * Applies K-Means clustering using the optimal K from the parameters.
    * Outputs analysis results to an Excel file (`test_image_data.xlsx`).
* **Experimental Notebook (`StarDist.ipynb`):**
    * Uses the StarDist library and a pre-trained model for nuclei segmentation on TIFF images.
